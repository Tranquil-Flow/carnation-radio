# fft-js
Pure Node.js implementation of the Fast Fourier Transform (Cooley-Tukey Method).

Note: normally inclusion of 'js' in the package name is discouraged. However many of the FFT implementations on NPM at the time this was written are wrappers for other languages like Ruby or C. We wanted to write our own, unoptimized implementation in pure Javascript as an educational tool. As a result it is called fft-js.

# Simple Example

    var fft = require('fft-js').fft,
        signal = [1,0,1,0];

    var phasors = fft(signal);

    console.log(phasors);

# Frequency/Magnitude Example

    var fft = require('fft-js').fft,
        fftUtil = require('fft-js').util,
        signal = [1,0,1,0];

    var phasors= fft(signal);

    var frequencies = fftUtil.fftFreq(phasors, 8000), // Sample rate and coef is just used for length, and frequency step
        magnitudes = fftUtil.fftMag(phasors); 

    var both = frequencies.map(function (f, ix) {
        return {frequency: f, magnitude: magnitudes[ix]};
    });

    console.log(both);

# Calculate IFFT of given phasors
    
    var ifft = require('fft-js').ifft;

    var phasors=[[1,0], [0,0], [1,0], [0,0]];

    var signal=ifft(phasors);

    console.log(signal);

#Calculate fft, modify phasors and calculate ifft

    var fft = require('fft-js').fft;
    var ifft = require('fft-js').ifft;

    var signal=[1,0,1,0];

    var phasors=fft(signal);

    console.log(phasors);

    phasors[2][0]=0;

    var signal2=ifft(phasors);

    console.log(signal2);

    
# Brute force O(n^2) DFT Example

The DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) is an unoptimized Fourier Transform for discrete data. In this project it is primarily a teaching tool, and is used to test the FFT.

    var dft = require('fft-js').dft,
        signal = [1,0,1,0];
    
    var phasors = dft(signal);
    
    console.log(phasors);

# Calculate IDFT of given phasors
    
    var idft = require('fft-js').idft;

    var phasors=[[1,0], [0,0], [1,0], [0,0]];

    var signal=idft(phasors);

    console.log(signal);

# In-place FFT Example

The in-place FFT implementation generates the FFT in-place, overwriting the original input vector. This is useful for minimizing new memory allocations required for the recursive version.

    var fftInPlace = require('fft-js').fftInPlace,
        signal = [1, 0, 1, 0];
        
    fftInPlace(signal);
    
    console.log(signal); //We have overwritten the original vector here with the FFT output.

# Command Line

For testing, you can run from the command line. Input is assumed to be from standard input and contain
a comma-delimited list of real numbers.

Command:
    node fft.js -s 44100 test/signal8.js

Console:

    Signal:  [ 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]

    FFT:  [ [ 4, 0 ],
    [ 1, -2.414213562373095 ],
    [ 0, 0 ],
    [ 1, -0.4142135623730949 ],
    [ 0, 0 ],
    [ 0.9999999999999999, 0.4142135623730949 ],
    [ 0, 0 ],
    [ 0.9999999999999997, 2.414213562373095 ] ]

    FFT Magnitudes:  [ 4, 2.613125929752753, 0, 1.0823922002923938 ] //We only see the first 4, because the 2nd 4 are the Nyquist frequency (discarded for aliasing), and then the mirror image negative frequencies.

    FFT Frequencies:  [ 0, 5512.5, 11025, 16537.5 ]
